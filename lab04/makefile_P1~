# My First Makefile
# Very important: the lines containing commands must start with
# a tab and not spaces!
# Also note that the pound symbol indicated the start of a comment
# which is usually helpful text used to annotate the makefile code

# This command will compile the source code when you run
# the make compile command at the command line prompt
compile:
	gcc Hello_HW1.c -o Hello_World.out

# This command will run the Hello World Program
run:
	./Hello_World.out

#Thsi command will "clean" out the directory of any output files
clean:
	rm *.out
